# Summary:
# My naive approach to understand why deriving at absolute depth from disparity loses accuracy after a particular and somewhat near distance ~ 1 meter. 

# Background: 
# We are able to acquire disparity map from iPhone's portrait photos.  From that we try to derive at an absolute depth information using the most intuitive conversion
# i.e. depth = 1 / disparity
# However this conversion made it very apparent that after 1.5m of distance, the derived values of absolute depth would become coarse.

# Theory:
# I wanted to entertain the idea of actually calculating the absolute depth more precisely using focal length, baseline and disparity values.  
# i.e. Z = focal_length * baseline / disparity
# I expected the results to be more consistent with uniform density even after 1 meter.

# However in order to calculate focal length in pixel, we needed some camera specifications such as focal length in mm, sensor width and image width.
# i.e. focal_length_px = (focal_length_mm / sensor_width_mm) * image_width_in_pixels

# Findings:
# Even after calculating absolute depth by focal length and baseline, the same pattern repeated; I lost granularity in absolute depth after 1 meter.
# It was apparent that there wasn't a linear correlation and I should have easily picked that up from 1 / disparity equation. 
# Furthermore, the baseline and focal-length only allowed granularity up to 1 meter. 
# If the baseline was increased to 545mm, then, the granularity of depth extends to 3.5 meters.  This made more sense because when the baseline increases, 
# the depth resolution increases as well.

# focal_length_px = (focal_length_mm / sensor_width_mm) * image_width_in_pixels
